    <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
    <p>Going to lecture and studying the powerpoints really helped me in learning because when I didn't understand
        something to include for the activities or assignments I would rely mostly on lectures and the powerpoints. I would
        also occasionally Google it if i needed a bit more help.</p>

    <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
    <p>I do not think I would change anything about the course because I found that everything really helped me in really
        understanding how to use CSS and how to use third party libraries.</p>

    <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? </h1>
    <p>Yes, I did. I was most curious about how positioning worked using CSS because before I only knew how to put text in the center. 
        I am really pleased about learning about floats and mostly CSS grids because I found grids to be easier than floating. I 
        am also really glad about learning more about third party libraries because I did not utilize them in COMP001A and now
        I know how to use them to really help me and my projects. </p>

    <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
    <p>I would say most concepts were new to me other than fonts, colors, and typography because I already knew about these from taking a design
        course. And I already knew HTML of course from earlier this semester. Third party libraries I already had heard of, like Bootstrap, but I 
        didn't know how to utilize them in the beginning of this class. However before these two courses I had no knowledge other than knowing HTML and CSS 
        were used in coding. </p>
